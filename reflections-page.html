       Week six came with an assortment of new concepts. One of which is spending more time with how the front end works. We used a CSS styling called Grid. Grid is a technique in Cascading Style Sheets that allows web developers to create complex responsive web design layouts more easily and consistently across browsers. With utilizing grid, it made designing the web page layout much more easier. It had a learning curve to for me moving the box and column layout was a difficult task to get done however with practice I did get it to work the way intended.
      Another new concept we went over was jQuery. It is a lightweight, write less, do more, JavaScript library. The purpose of jQuery is to make it much easier to use JavaScript on your website. jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code. It also simplifies a lot of the complicated things from JavaScript, like AJAX calls and DOM manipulation.
      	We also began to connect the HTML with the functionality of JavaScript. In doing so allowed functionality to our web pages. As an example of interactive buttons that could change the background color or font size of the letters all without a rerender. Something I really enjoyed about this is giving me the background understanding of how user login forms work. From hands on experience I feel that I am getting more comfortable with the front end.
      Something that stood out to me was learning to use the in browser inspector to be able to see the web page components and styling elements. Very convenient to change the webpage styles  in browser and then go back to your code and update it. Visiting common websites such as Facebook or amazing and then using the in browser inspector to see all of the html code along with the styling code has changed my perspective of how web pages look and function. I am very excited to see what is to come from the next few weeks of the CodeCrew BootCamp.

        During week five of the CodeCrew Bootcamp, we learned the basic foundations for HTML. Starting off Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages such as JavaScript. Most if not all website web pages are structured using HTML. Our instructors did a marvelous job at explaining the foundations of HTML.
        Although exhausting it was a great experience constructing webpages from our local machines and then being able to style the webpage to look much more professional. Understanding how HTML web pages work and function opened my eyes to seeing websites very differently. An example is we were tasked with constructing Login forms for users. A user would enter a Username, password and email to register. After doing this several times I begin to notice much of what we did in class is very similar to what most websites use.
        We were also taught the very simple basics of CSS. Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML (including XML dialects such as SVG, MathML or XHTML). CSS describes how elements should be rendered on screen, on paper, in speech, or on other media. With the combined knowledge of HTML & CSS, we were able to construct web pages that appealed to the user eye. Seeing the improvements along the way with using different methods made the experience much more unique in understanding how different code work together to form a goal. I am very excited for what’s to come next week.

        Another week has come to pass with the CodeCrew boot camp. During week four, we did another team project. Working along side a teammate was a great experience cooperating to solve the task at hand. Working with someone is a great strategy for problem solving. Being able to read your code out loud to your partner helped clear up obstacles for completing the project.
        Another great team building strategy was splitting the work load. Coordinating on which parts of the project a member is responsible building. As a programmer, projects can seem intimidating however I’ve come to learn that breaking down the massive chunks of code into the simplest, smallest lines of code can greatly help simplify the process. During week four we spent a great amount of time learning about classes with python. The purpose of classes in python is the combination of storing data and having functionality. Another added benefit to using classes is it cleans a lot of code up. You can accomplish the same effect with less lines of code with classes when it comes to project building.
        As the week came to an end, we were given our first assessment test. The test was intimidating and somewhat stressful. Having a timer over your head and not being able to use any of your notes during the test posed a daunting task. With the addition of being told that if you did not pass the test, you would risk not being able to continue with the bootcamp. In an unsettling way the test went on and so did the interviews. I remember thinking how badly I wanted to succeed with this test. I am looking forward to seeing what the next week brings me.

        Week three was the learning of Python programming language. Being a completely new language to learn for me was a challenge but with time became much easier. Thanks to learning JavaScript first it made things much more easier to comprehend. Learning the foundations of Python included basic variable, loops and nesting of both variables and loops.
        Moving from using the web browser to the terminal was a change in how the process went. Although it was daunting at first, it became exciting working within the terminal. Running the application via terminal commands and making it render in the terminal was really cool experience. I am very excited for what lays ahead in the coming weeks of Boot Camp.

        Week two was more of a challenge for me. Learning the new concept of classes. Adding arrays, converting an array into an object. Taking the object and making a string to store the variables. It was a challenge for me however with determination and repeated practice I wound up grasping the concept of classes. Combining the classes with function calls and using while loops to check the variables to render the data was a huge challenge.  Thanks to the wonderful instructors we have, utilizing the extra tutoring time really helped me get over the difficult walls. My expectations for the coming week are high with this boot camp.

        My first week of the CodeCrew bootcamp was exciting. We learned about the basic fundamental building blocks of Javascript.
        Some of the fundamentals were variables, objects, HTML, CSS, for loops and while loops.
        For me there was a learning curve to understanding how to make use of the Javascript language.
        However with time and practice I soon began to understand much more clearly. I have high hopes for the future with this bootcamp.
