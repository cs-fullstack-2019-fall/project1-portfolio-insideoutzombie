<strong>Final thoughts</strong>

        What I’m trying to say in this story — and hopefully share and convey — is that no matter how hard things are, no matter how much weight is placed on your shoulders, no matter how many times you fail or struggle, never give up. Never quit fighting for what you truly want out of life. No matter what education you have or what job you work, you too can fulfill your dreams. If that’s coding, that’s coding, but it can be anything else. The lessons in this story can be applied to anything you are passionate about. You are the creator of your destiny.

        It was around late 2012 I was 18-years old and attended Vatterott college with the goal to become a professional automotive technician. I was there for roughly 3 months when I had discovered I was on the schools honor role list and so I dropped out. The reason being was during that time at school I realized I had a special ability. I took it upon myself to download a service manual for my 97 Honda Prelude and would just worked on my own car. I would go out into the schools parking lot tearing my car apart and fixing the things that were broke. It was a ton of trial and error of course. However I learned a very valuable thing about myself. I learned that I was fully capable of teaching myself. Our shops teacher would tell the other students to just watch what I was doing. I felt that I wasn't learning anything from the school to justify me staying and acquiring so much debt. The 3 months I was enrolled landed me a little over $8,000 in student loan debt. Had I stayed there for the full 2 year program, I would have been over $40,000 in debt with an outstanding high interest rate. I made the realization that I was fully capable of teaching myself and that I knew I could simply get a job somewhere that would Pay Me to basically learn as I go. Thats what I did. I approached a local Automotive performance shop that worked on anything that had an engine, modified cars, and installed performance parts. I was able to pay off my $8,000 debt within 10months of working for that shop.

        I was an automotive tech from August of 2013 until October of 2017. During my years of working there I got really good at what I could do, I had a really great boss, however it was a lot of hard labor for a small 5 bay shop that would constantly be over 2–3 weeks booked in advance just for people to get there car in for repairs. Each day I would have to move on average 15–30 cars to open the shop up and then move them all back into place to close down. About 90% of the time I was outside in the weather hot or cold, rain or snow, pulling engines, dropping transmissions and many other labor intense jobs. It was around this time when I grew tired and weary of always working in such conditions for the amount of pay that I realized I wanted more out of life and that this job just wasn't cutting it for the cost of living and being a home owner with an expensive car hobby. I new there was more to life and that there was something I could do to live more comfortably and not have to work nearly as hard to keep the bills paid. It was the beginning of 2017 when I finally began to take it serious that if I was to make it out of this life cycle to a better life that I would have to take action! Although every day that I worked I would get destroyed tired, exhausted, and 9 out of 10 times filthy from the dirty work. I would go home and start learning what I could do. I looked at many things such as buying and selling products online, passive income, retail arbitrage, starting my own online drop shipping company, and looked into various career choices I could take that would ultimately lead me to a high paying comfortable life.
