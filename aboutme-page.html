        Growing up I was nothing special. I had no special trait that set me apart from the other kids in school or in my family. The only thing I had was being diagnosed at such a young age with Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). If there was anything I wanted to learn, I had to reread multiple times, practice multiple times to get it locked in my memory. I never really did well in school either. I was just a C & D student who only did what was needed to just get by with. I never liked school or having to be told what I should do and what I should learn. It was difficult for me trying to identify what may interest me or what cold be a passion for me. The only thing I enjoyed was playing video games, not much else. What started my journey in life of pursuing a passion was when I watched the first fast & furious movie. I was 15 years old at the time, and remember how excited I got watching the import tuner cars in the movie. That was the day my hobby for the race car life began. From there on with time I pursued this passion by buying my first import tuner a 2000 Honda Civic Si. It was a beat up and neglected car but nonetheless it was a five speed manual that ran and drove.

        It was around late 2012 I was 18-years old and attended Vatterott college with the goal to become a professional automotive technician. I was there for roughly 3 months when I had discovered I was on the schools honor role list and so I dropped out. The reason being was during that time at school I realized I had a special ability. I took it upon myself to download a service manual for my 97 Honda Prelude and would just worked on my own car. I would go out into the schools parking lot tearing my car apart and fixing the things that were broke. It was a ton of trial and error of course. However I learned a very valuable thing about myself. I learned that I was fully capable of teaching myself. Our shops teacher would tell the other students to just watch what I was doing. I felt that I wasn't learning anything from the school to justify me staying and acquiring so much debt. The 3 months I was enrolled landed me a little over $8,000 in student loan debt. Had I stayed there for the full 2 year program, I would have been over $40,000 in debt with an outstanding high interest rate. I made the realization that I was fully capable of teaching myself and that I knew I could simply get a job somewhere that would Pay Me to basically learn as I go. Thats what I did. I approached a local Automotive performance shop that worked on anything that had an engine, modified cars, and installed performance parts. I was able to pay off my $8,000 debt within 10months of working for that shop.

        I was an automotive tech from August of 2013 until October of 2017. During my years of working there I got really good at what I could do, I had a really great boss, however it was a lot of hard labor for a small 5 bay shop that would constantly be over 2–3 weeks booked in advance just for people to get there car in for repairs. Each day I would have to move on average 15–30 cars to open the shop up and then move them all back into place to close down. About 90% of the time I was outside in the weather hot or cold, rain or snow, pulling engines, dropping transmissions and many other labor intense jobs. It was around this time when I grew tired and weary of always working in such conditions for the amount of pay that I realized I wanted more out of life and that this job just wasn't cutting it for the cost of living and being a home owner with an expensive car hobby. I new there was more to life and that there was something I could do to live more comfortably and not have to work nearly as hard to keep the bills paid. It was the beginning of 2017 when I finally began to take it serious that if I was to make it out of this life cycle to a better life that I would have to take action! Although every day that I worked I would get destroyed tired, exhausted, and 9 out of 10 times filthy from the dirty work. I would go home and start learning what I could do. I looked at many things such as buying and selling products online, passive income, retail arbitrage, starting my own online drop shipping company, and looked into various career choices I could take that would ultimately lead me to a high paying comfortable life.
